# - @State is used when the state variable has value-type semantics; this is because any mutation of the property creates a new copy of the variable (Swift tends to encourage and prioritize value-type semantics, but reference semantics can never be ignored)

# - but what about a property with reference semantics?
# ! in this case, any mutation of the variable is applied to the variable itself, and SwiftUI cannot detect the variation by itself

# !!!
# - we must use a different property wrapper, @ObservedObject, and the observed object must conform to the ObservableObject protocol
# - furthermore, the properties (of this object that will be observed in the view) must be decorated with @Published property wrapper

# Basically, we are using a class as a state variable, and decide which properties will trigger a re-rendering of the view




# In this recipe, we are simply wrapping CLLoctionManager in an ObservableObject and publishing 2 properties: authorization status, current location.

import CoreLocation

class LocationManager: NSObject, ObservableObject {
    private let LocationManager = CLLocationManager()
    @Published var status: CLAuthorizationStatus?
    @Published var current: CLLocation?

    # init; we're configuring CLLocationManger to react when teh location changes by 10 meters 

    override init() {
        super.init()
        locationManager.delegate = self
        locationManager.distanceFilter = 10
        locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest
        locationManger.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()
        locationManager.startUpdatingLocation()
    }
}

# We are setting LocationManager as a delegate to CLLocationManager and using this extension to confirm it to the appropriate protocol
# - setting a delegate means that the LocationManager class (our custom class) is acting as a delegate for CLLocationManager
# - this extension makes LocationManager conform to the CLLocationManagerDelegate protocol, meaning that LocationManager will handle location updates and authorization changes from CLLocationManager

/* 

How Does Delegation Work?

- CLLocationManager Needs a Delegate
- CLLocationManager is responsible for providing location updates.
- However, it does not know where to send the updates unless you assign a delegate.

- locationManager.delegate = self (from LocationManager) tells CLLocationManager that whenever a location update happens, it should notify this instance of LocationManager



Why Use Delegates Instead of Closures?

- Appleâ€™s delegate pattern allows for continuous event-driven updates.
- Using delegates reduces memory leaks compared to closures when dealing with system frameworks.
